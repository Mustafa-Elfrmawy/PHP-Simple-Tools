# PHP-Simple-Tools

This repository contains a collection of simple and reusable PHP classes created for learning and practicing PHP fundamentals.

Each folder represents a standalone utility class that solves a common programming task:
- **Curl** â€“ A class to simplify sending HTTP requests with cURL.
- **GitHubManager** â€“ A class that interacts with the GitHub REST API (CRUD operations for repositories).
- **DatabaseHandler** â€“ A PDO-based class for interacting with a MySQL database.

## Structure

- `Curl/` - Contains `Curl.php` with a class to send GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests.
- `GitHubManager/` - Contains logic to create, edit, delete, and fetch GitHub repositories using GitHub API.
- `DatabaseHandler/` - Provides a simple abstraction for basic database operations (select, insert, update, delete).

Each folder includes its own `README.md` file explaining how to use the class inside.
